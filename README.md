COVID-19 State, county-level maps
Poorly Commented Code, reach out for questions.

The purpose of these maps is to illustrate the difference between Case count and Incidence. In this case when I am referring to incidence it means: incidence = (count / (population/10000))

*note: Pay special attention to the County Names from the census data. Examine the county names for each state, they need to be modified slightly for counties with more than one space in the name for these maps to handle the data properly. County Level data will come back missing if names mismatch.
